Explanation of the docker-compose.yml Configuration Parameter Selection:
Jenkins Service:
	Image: jenkins/jenkins:lts
		Reason: Uses the Long-Term Support (LTS) version of Jenkins for stability and long-term support with critical updates.
	User: root
		Reason: Ensures Jenkins has the necessary permissions to execute Docker commands within the container.
	Container Name: jenkins
		Reason: Simplifies identification and management of the Jenkins container.
	Depends On: dind
		Reason: Ensures that the dind (Docker-in-Docker) container is started before Jenkins to make Docker available for Jenkins operations.
	Ports:
		8080:8080 (Jenkins web interface)
		50000:50000 (Jenkins agent communication)
		Reason: Exposes Jenkins web interface and agent communication ports for external access.
	Volumes:
		./jenkins:/var/jenkins_home
		/usr/bin/docker:/usr/bin/docker
		Reason:
			./jenkins:/var/jenkins_home mounts the host's jenkins directory to persist Jenkins data.
			/usr/bin/docker:/usr/bin/docker allows Jenkins to access Docker commands.
	Environment Variables: DOCKER_HOST: "tcp://dind:2375"
		Reason: Configures Jenkins to communicate with the Docker daemon in the dind container.
	Networks: jenkins_dind
		Reason: Uses the jenkins_dind network for communication between Jenkins and Docker-in-Docker containers.

DinD (Docker-In-Docker) Service:
	Image: docker:20.10-dind
		Reason: Provides Docker-in-Docker functionality using the specified Docker version.
	User: root
		Reason: Required to run Docker commands and perform privileged operations inside the container.
	Container Name: dind
		Reason: Clearly identifies the Docker-in-Docker container.
	Privileged Mode: true
		Reason: Necessary for running Docker within Docker to allow full Docker functionality.
	Expose: 2375
		Reason: Exposes Docker API on port 2375 for internal communication within the Docker network.
	Networks: jenkins_dind
		Reason: Connects to the same network as Jenkins to allow communication between the services.
	Environment Variables: DOCKER_TLS_CERTDIR: ""
		Reason: Disables Docker TLS certificates for internal communication.

Networks:
	jenkins_dind:
		Reason: Creates a bridge network for communication between Jenkins and Docker-in-Docker services.
